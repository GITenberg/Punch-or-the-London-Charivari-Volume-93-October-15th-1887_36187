<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Hoctober, my 'arty, and <span class="smcap">'Arry</span>, wus luck! 's back in town,</span>
  <span class="i2">Where it's all gitting messy and misty; the boollyvard trees is all
  brown,</span>
  <span class="i2">Them as ain't gone as yaller as mustard. I <i>do</i> 'ate the Autumn,
  dear boy,</span>
  <span class="i2">When a feller 'as spent his last quid, and there's nothink to do or
  enjoy.</span>
    </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Cut it spicy, old man, by the briny, I did, and no error. That Loo</span>
  <span class="i2">Was a rattler to keep up the pace whilst a bloke 'ad a brown left to
  blue.</span>
  <span class="i2">Cleared me out a rare bat, I can tell yer; no Savings Bank lay about
  <i>her</i>.</span>
  <span class="i2">Yah!&mdash;Women is precious like cats, ony jest while you strokes 'em they
  purr.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Lor', to think wot a butterfly beauty I was when I started, old pal!</span>
  <span class="i2">Natty cane, and a weed like a hoop-stick, and now!&mdash;oh, well, jigger
  that gal!</span>
  <span class="i2">Cut me slap in the Strand ony yesterday, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, so 'elp me,
  she did.</span>
  <span class="i2">Well, of sech a false baggage as Loo is, yours truly is jolly well rid.</span>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Wot a thing this yer Ochre is, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>! The yaller god rules
  us all round.</span>
  <span class="i2">Parsons patter of poverty's pleasures! I tell yer they ain't to be
  found.</span>
  <span class="i2">If you 'aven't the ha'pence you're nothink; bang out of it, slap up
  a tree.</span>
  <span class="i2">That's a moral, as every man as is not a mere mug must agree.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">They talks of "the Masses and Classes,"&mdash;old Collars is red on that
  rot!&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i2">There is ony two classes, old pal, them as 'as it and them as 'as not.</span>
  <span class="i2">The Ochre, I mean, mate, the spondulicks, call the dashed stuff wot
  you please.</span>
  <span class="i2">It's the Lucre as makes Life worth livin', without it things ain't
  wuth a sneeze.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">O <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, I wish I'd got millions! I <i>ought</i> to be rich,
  and no kid.</span>
  <span class="i2">I feel I wos made for it, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. To watch every bloomin'
  arf quid,</span>
  <span class="i2">Like a pup at a rat 'ole is beastly. Some stingy 'uns <i>carn't</i>
  go the pace,</span>
  <span class="i2">But I know I should turn out a flyer, and so ought to be in the race.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Oh, it ain't every juggins, I tell yer, who's built for the bullion,
  dear boy!</span>
  <span class="i2">You must know the snide game that's called "Grab," you must know what
  it means to "enjoy."</span>
  <span class="i2">Neither one without tother's much use, but the true Ochre Kings are
  the chaps</span>
  <span class="i2">As can squeeze millions out of "the Masses." They win in life's game,
  mate, by laps.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">That's jest wot "the Masses" is made for; <i>them asses</i> I calls
  'em, old man,</span>
  <span class="i2">Same letters, same thing, dontcher know. Yus, Socierty's built on
  this plan.</span>
  <span class="i2">Many littles makes lots, that's the maxim; and he is the snide 'un,
  no doubt,</span>
  <span class="i2">Who can squeeze his lot out of the littles of half the poor mugs
  who're about.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Twig, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, old twister? Yer sweaters, yer Giant
  Purviders, and such</span>
  <span class="i2">Is all on that lay. Many buds, and one big bloated Bee, that's the
  touch!</span>
  <span class="i2">Wy, if bees was as many as blossoms, or blossoms as few as the bees,</span>
  <span class="i2">Him as nicked a whole hive to hisself would find dashed little honey
  to squeeze.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">The honey&mdash;or money&mdash;wants <i>massing</i>, that's jest wot the Masses
  can do&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i2">And the "Classes," my boy, are the picked 'uns, as know 'ow to put on
  the screw.</span>
  <span class="i2">That's the doctrine of "<span class="smcap">Dannel</span> the Dosser," a broken-down
  toff, as I know;</span>
  <span class="i2">And if <span class="smcap">Dannel</span> ain't right, I'm a Dutchman. <i>That's</i> ow
  yer big money-piles grow.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Rum party the Dosser is, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>&mdash;I can't make him out, mate,
  not quite.</span>
  <span class="i2">Laps beer, when he can, like a bricky, though brandy's his mark. His
  delight</span>
  <span class="i2">Is to patter to me about Swelldom, Socierty, wot he calls gammon&mdash;</span>
  <span class="i2">That's Ochre, dear boy, dontcher know. I suppose arf his gab is sheer
  mammon.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">He eyes me in sech a rum style, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, sort of arf smile and
  arf sneer,</span>
  <span class="i2">Though he owns I'm a Dasher right down to the ground&mdash;when he's well
  on the beer.</span>
  <span class="i2">A pot and a pipe always dror him, and I'm always game to stand Sam,</span>
  <span class="i2">For his patter's A1, and I pump 'im,&mdash;a lay as he stands like a lamb.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"You <i>ought</i> to be rich, my young Cloten!" sez he. It's a part of
  his game</span>
  <span class="i2">To call me nicknames out of <i>Shakspeare</i>, and so on; but "Wot's in
  a name?"</span>
  <span class="i2">"My brain and your 'eart now together, would make a rare Dives," says
  "Dosser."</span>
  <span class="i2">I don't always know wot he means, and I doubt if <i>he</i> does, poor
  old josser!</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">'Owsomever, the Ochre's my toppic. Some jugginses talk about "Thrift,"</span>
  <span class="i2">Penny Savings' Bank bosh, and that stuff. Wouldn't 'ave their dashed
  brains at a gift.</span><br />
  <span class="i2"><i>Save</i>, hay,&mdash;out of two quid a week! No, it doesn't fetch me in
  that shape.</span>
  <span class="i2">You must <i>swag</i> in this world to get rich; if yer carn't, it's no
  bottles to <i>scrape</i>.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">The Turf or the Stock Exchange, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, would suit me, I'd trust
  to my luck,</span>
  <span class="i2">And my leariness, <i>not</i> to get plucked like that silly young
  Ailesbury duck,</span>
  <span class="i2">Wot's life without sport? Wy, like billiards without e'er a bet or a
  fluke,</span>
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And that's wy I'd be a Swell Bookie&mdash;that is if I carn't be a Dook.</span>
 </div>
  <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">In fact if I 'ad my own chice, I should jest like to <i>double the</i>
  <i>part</i>,</span>
  <span class="i2">As I fancy a few on 'em do. Oh, Jemimer! jest give me a start.</span>
  <span class="i2">With a 'undered or two, and the Ochre I'd pile 'twould take waggons to
  carry.</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Turning To the Left.</span>&mdash;At a recent meeting of the Court of Common Council
(in the teeth of a strong opposition of some of the members of the
Board) it was decided to exclude strangers and the Press during a part
of the proceedings. The matter under secret consideration, it is said,
was the appointment by the Recorder of the Assistant-Judge of the
Mayor's Court. It is rumoured that, acting on the opinion of Mr. <span class="smcap">R. S.
Wright</span>, (with him the Attorney-General) the Court decided not to confirm
that appointment. But why all this mystery? What had the Councillors to
fear? Obviously, they could be doing nothing wrong if they were
sustained by <span class="smcap">Wright</span>!</p>

<h3>A LORD MAYOR'S DAY IN DUBLIN.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Lay of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"Shure it's <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> would be troublin', meeself Lord Mayor o' Dublin,</span>
  <span class="i3">But every charge he makes I'll meet in fashion you'll call nate;</span>
  <span class="i2">For I'll face the accusation that he brings against the <i>Nation</i>,</span>
  <span class="i3">Attired from head to foot, my boys, in all my robes of State.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">"So on with hat and gown, boys, for we're goin' through the town, boys,</span>
  <span class="i3">And you must help your City's Chief to make a real display,"</span>
  <span class="i2">Thus <span class="smcap">Tim Sullivan</span> he cried out, as straightway he did ride out,</span>
  <span class="i3">In civic pomp to near the Court on that eventful day.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">And Town Councillors in numbers, woke from their normal slumbers,</span>
  <span class="i3">And, donning gowns and tippets, rose and put on all they knew,</span>
  <span class="i2">And with approbation glancing at the City Marshal, prancing</span>
  <span class="i3">On a hired hack, they followed him, a rather motley crew.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">At length the Court they entered, when attention soon was centred,</span>
  <span class="i3">On a squabble that had risen about the Sword and Mace:</span>
  <span class="i2">For some swore they were not able to lie upon the table,</span>
  <span class="i3">Though the Lord Mayor hotly argued it was their proper place.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">So when 'twas shown quite plainly, after pushing for it vainly,</span>
  <span class="i3">Beyond the "bar" the civic baubles had to be conveyed,</span>
  <span class="i2">With vow that none should floor them, their guardians upstairs bore them,</span>
  <span class="i3">And in the front seats flaunted them conspicuously displayed.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Then up stood Mr. <span class="smcap">Carson</span>, quite as quiet as a parson,</span>
  <span class="i3">And read out his indictment with a settled, stone-like face,</span>
  <span class="i2">Till <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span>, quick replying, rose then and there, denying</span>
  <span class="i3">That the Counsel for the Crown had a shadow of a case.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">And then as legal brother argued each against the other,</span>
  <span class="i3">The while <span class="smcap">Tim Sullivan</span> reclined in all his civic blaze,</span>
  <span class="i2"><span class="smcap">O'Donel</span> he looked vexed there, and he seemed somewhat perplexed there,</span>
  <span class="i3">As if the matter struck him as involved in doubtful haze.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">But after some reflection, with a <i>soupçon</i> of dejection,</span>
  <span class="i3">He announced that he had settled (though, doubtless, mid some fears</span>
  <span class="i2">He might stir up <span class="smcap">Balfour's</span> fury), there was no case for a jury.</span>
  <span class="i3">His judgment was received in Court with hearty ringing cheers.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Then, wild with exultation, up rose Mayor and Corporation,</span>
  <span class="i3">And, greeted by the crowd without, were cheered along the way,</span>
  <span class="i2">Til the Mansion House on nearing, the mob cried, 'midst their cheering,</span>
  <span class="i3">A speech they wanted, and would hear what he had got to say.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">Then <span class="smcap">Tim Sullivan</span> he spouted;&mdash;the mob they surged and shouted,</span>
  <span class="i3">And the upshot of the speech was this, that if, through legal flaws,</span>
  <span class="i2">By any chance your way you see, to battle with the powers that be,</span>
  <span class="i3">You're hero both and martyr if you break the Saxon's laws.</span>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i2">So it's no use, <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>, troublin' the Civic powers of Dublin;</span>
  <span class="i3">For if you do, you know that they will meet you just half way;</span>
  <span class="i2">And if fresh accusation you but bring against the <i>Nation</i>,</span>
  <span class="i3">The City shure will answer with another Lord Mayor's Day!</span>

<h3>THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Before</i> Mr. Commissioner <span class="smcap">Punch</span>.)</p>

<p class="center"><i>An Official of Epping Forest introduced.</i></p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> Now, Sir, what can I do for you?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> You can confer a favour upon me, Sir, by correcting some
sensational letters and paragraphs on "Deer-Maiming in Epping Forest,"
that have lately appeared in the newspapers.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> Always pleased to oblige the Corporation. Well, what
is it?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> I wish to say, Sir, that deer-shooting in Epping Forest, so
far as its guardians are concerned, is not a sport, but a difficult and
disagreeable duty?</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> A duty?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> Yes, Sir, a duty; because, in fulfilment of an agreement with
the late Lords of the Forest Manors (to whom we have to supply annually
a certain amount of venison), and in justice to the neighbouring
farmers, whose crops are much damaged by the deer, we are obliged to
keep down the herd to a fixed limit.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> But how about the stories of the wounded animals
that linger and die?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> We have nothing to do with them&mdash;we are not in fault. I
mean by "we" those who have a right to shoot by the invitation of the
proper Authorities.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> But are not the poor animals sometimes wounded?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> Alas, yes! Unhappily the forest is infested by a gang of
poachers of the worst type, and it is at their door that any charge of
cruelty must be laid. So far as we are concerned, we kill the deer in
the most humane manner. We use rifles and bullets, and our guns are
excellent shots. As no doubt you will have seen from the report of the
City Solicitor, such deer as it has been necessary to kill, have been
shot by, or in the presence of, two of the Conservators renowned for
their humanity and shooting skill.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> It seems to me that you should put down the
poachers.</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> We do our best, Sir. You must remember the Corporation has
not been in possession very long. We have to protect nearly ten square
miles of forest land, close to a city whose population is counted by
Millions.</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> Very true. Can I do anything more for you?</p>

<p><i>Witness.</i> Nothing, Sir. Pray accept my thanks for affording me this
opportunity of offering an explanation. I trust the explanation is
satisfactory?</p>

<p><i>The Commissioner.</i> Perfectly. (<i>The Witness then withdrew.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skurrie</span> puts us in the train, gives us our <span class="smcap">Cook's</span> tickets all ready
stamped and dated. No trouble. Then he insists on comparing his notes of
our route with mine, to see that all is correct.</p>

<p>"Wednesday," he says, "that's to-day. Geneva <i>dep.</i> 12, Bâle <i>arr.</i>
7.45." He speaks a <i>Bradshaw</i> abbreviated language. "Change twice,
perhaps three times, Lausanne, Brienne, Olten. Not quite sure; but you
must look out." Oh, the trouble and anxiety of looking out for where you
change! "Then," he goes on, "Thursday, Bâle <i>dep.</i> 9.2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, Heidelberg
<i>arr.</i> 1.55."</p>

<p>"Any change?" I ask, as if I wanted twopence out of a shilling.</p>

<p>"No; at least I don't think so. But you had better ask," he replies. Ah!
this asking! if you are not quite well, and don't understand the
language (which I do not in German Switzerland), and get hold of an
austere military station-master, or an imbecile porter, and then have to
carry that most inconvenient article of all baggage, a hand-bag, which
you have brought as "so convenient to hold everything you want for a
night," and which is so light to carry until it is packed! "Then," goes
on the imperturbable <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span>, "you'll 'do' Heidelberg, dine there, sleep
there, and on Friday Heidelberg <i>dep.</i> 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I interrupt with a groan&mdash;"Can't we go later?"</p>

<p>"No," says <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span>, sternly. "Impossible. You'll upset all the
calculations if you do."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span> says, meekly, that when one is travelling, and going to bed early,
it is not so difficult to get up very early, and, for her part, she
knows she shall be awake all night. Ah! so shall I, I feel, and already
the journey begins to weigh heavily on me, and I do not bless <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span>
and his plan. "But," I say aloud, knowing he has done it all for the
best, and that I cannot now recede, "go on."</p>

<p>He does so, at railroad pace:&mdash;"Heidelberg <i>dep.</i> 6. Mannheim <i>arr.</i>
7.5, <i>dep.</i> 7.15. Mayence <i>arr.</i> 8.22, in time for boat down the Rhine
8.55. Cologne <i>arr.</i> 4.30. And there you are."</p>

<p>"Yes," I rejoin, rather liking the idea of Cologne, "there we are&mdash;and
then?"</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have a longish morning at Cologne; rest, see Cathedral,
breakfast," and here he refers to his notes, "Cologne <i>dep.</i> 1.13 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
and Antwerp <i>arr.</i> 6.34."</p>

<p>"Change anywhere?" I inquire, helplessly. "Yes," he answers,
meditatively. "At this moment I forget where, but you've got examination
of baggage on the Belgian frontier, and you have two changes, I think.
However, it's all easy enough."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," I say, trying to cheer up a bit, only somehow I am
depressed: and Cousin <span class="smcap">Jane</span> isn't much better, though she tries to put
everything in the pleasantest possible light, and remarks that at all
events "the travelling will soon be over."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skurrie</span> continues reading off his paper and comparing the
details with my notes, "Sunday&mdash;Antwerp <i>dep.</i> 6.34 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
Rosendael <i>arr.</i> 7.45&mdash;yes&mdash;then Rosendael <i>dep.</i> 8.44, and
catch the 10.10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> boat at Flushing. Queenborough
<i>arr.</i> 5.50, fresh as a lark, and up to town by 7.55."</p>

<p>"But we don't want to go up to town, we want to go to Ramsgate."</p>

<p>"Ha!" he says slowly, giving this idea as just sprung upon him his full
consideration. "Ha!&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;" Then, as if by inspiration, he
continues quickly&mdash;"sacrifice your London tickets, book luggage for
Flushing, only then at Flushing re-book it for Queenborough, and once
you're there you catch an early train to Ramsgate, and you'll be there
nearly as soon as you would have arrived in London. Train just off. Wish
you <i>bon voyage</i>."</p>

<p>I thank him for all his trouble, and ask, with some astonishment, if he
is not going to accompany us?</p>

<p>"Can't&mdash;wish I could," returns <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span>, "but I've got to go off to
Petersburgh by night mail. Business. Should have been delighted to have
looked after you and seen you through, but you've got it all down and
can't make any mistake. <i>Au plaisir!</i>"</p>

<p>And he is off. So are we.</p>

<p>Oh, this journey!! Everything changes. My health, the scenery, the
weather, all becoming worse and worse. Poor Cousin <span class="smcap">Jane</span>, too.</p>

<p>Oh, the changes of carriage! The rushing about from platform to
platform, carrying that confounded bag, and sticks, and umbrellas, and
small things, of which <span class="smcap">Jane</span>&mdash;poor <span class="smcap">Jane</span>!&mdash;has her
share, and, but for her sticking to every basket and package, I should,
in despair, have surrendered to chance, left them behind me somewhere,
and should have never seen them again. All aches and pains, and
weariness! At last at Bâle, rattled over stones and bridge in a jolting
omnibus, through pouring rain to the hotel of "The Three Kings."</p>

<p>Our treatment in the <i>salle-à-manger</i> of that Monarchical Hostelrie is
enough to make the most loyal turn republican. A willing head-waiter
with insubordinate assistants&mdash;and we are miserable.</p>

<p>Off early to Heidelberg. Delighted, at all events, to bid farewell to
the worthy Monarchs. This trip seemed to invigorate us, and if civility,
polite attention, good rooms, and an excellent <i>cuisine</i> could make any
invalid temporarily better, then our short stay at the Prinz Karl
Hotel&mdash;a really perfectly managed establishment&mdash;ought to have revived
us both considerably. And so it did. A lovely drive to the heights among
the pine woods and in the purest air went for something, but alas the
knowledge that we had to rise at 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, to be off by six&mdash;it turned out
to be a 6.30 train&mdash;drove slumber from our eyes, and only by means of a
cold bath, the first thing on tumbling out of bed, could I brace myself
for the effort. Then on we went, taking <span class="smcap">Skurrie's</span> pre-arranged tour.</p>

<p>Let the remainder be a blank.</p>

<p>When abroad I had bought a French one-volume novel which I had seen
praised in the <i>Figaro</i>. I will not give its name, nor that of its
author. If it indeed portrays persons really living in Paris, and if
these persons are not wholly exceptional (but, if so, why this novel,
which implies the contrary and denounces them?) then is the latest state
of Republican Paris worse than its former state in the days of the
<i>dégringolade</i> of the Empire, and Paris must undergo a fearful purgation
before she will once again possess <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>. I read
this disgusting novel half-way through until its meaning became quite
clear to me, and then I proceeded by leaps and bounds, landing on dry
places and skipping over the filth in order to see how the author worked
out a moral and punished his infamous scoundrel of a chief personage.
No. Moral there was none, except an eloquent appeal to Paris to rise and
crush these reptiles and their brood. On the wretched night when
feverish, ill, and sleepless, I lay miserably in the saloon of the
Flemish steamer crossing to Queenborough, I opened the porthole above me
and threw this infernal book into the sea. After this I bore the
sufferings of that night with a lighter heart.</p>

<hr />

<p>Suffice it that I arrived at home&mdash;and how glad I was to get
there&mdash;broken down, prostrate and only fit for
bed&mdash;&mdash;where with railways running round and round my head,
steamboats dashing and thumping about my brain, the shrieks of German
and Flemish porters ringing in my ears, <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span> always forcing me to
travel on, on, on, against my will, I remained for about three weeks.</p>

<p><i>Advice gratis to all Drinkers of Waters.</i>&mdash;"The story shows," as
the Moral to the fables of <span class="smcap">Æsop</span> used to put it, that when you have
finished your cure, make straight by the easiest stages for the seaside
at home. Avoid all exertion: and ask your medical man before leaving to
tell you exactly what to eat, drink, and avoid, for the next three weeks
at least after the completion of your cure.</p>

<hr />

<p>While ill, but when beginning to crave for some amusement or
distraction, I asked that my dear old <span class="smcap">Boz's</span> <i>Sketches</i> should be read to
me, to which in years gone by I had been indebted for many a hearty
laugh. Alas! what a disappointment! Except for a little descriptive bit
here and there, the fun of these <i>Sketches</i> sounded as wearisome and
old-fashioned as the humours of the now forgotten "Adelphi screamers" in
which Messrs. <span class="smcap">Wright</span> and <span class="smcap">Paul Bedford</span> used to perform, and at which, as
a boy, I used to scream with delight, when the strong-minded mistress of
the house, speaking while the comic servant was laying the cloth for
dinner, would say of her husband, "When I see him I'll give him&mdash;&mdash;"
"Pepper," says the comic servant, accidentally placing that condiment on
the table. "He shan't," resumes the irate lady, "come over me with
any&mdash;&mdash;" "Butter," interrupts the comic servant, quite unconsciously, of
course, as he deposits a pat of Dorset on the table. And so on. Later
on, I tried <span class="smcap">Thackeray's</span> <i>Esmond</i>. How tedious, how involved, and full of
repetitions! It is enlivened here and there by the introduction of such
real characters as <i>Dick Steele</i>, <i>Lord Mohun</i>, <i>Dean Atterbury</i>, and
others, and by the mysterious melodramatic appearances and
disappearances of <i>Father Holt</i>, a typical Jesuit of the "penny
dreadful" style of literature. But the work had lost whatever charm it
ever possessed for me, and, indeed, I had always considered it an
over-rated book, not by any means to be compared with <i>Vanity Fair</i>,
<i>Pendennis</i>, or even with <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, which last is repulsively
clever.</p>

<hr />

<p>Then I asked for a book that I never yet could get through, and to which
I thought that now, with leisure and a craving for distraction, I might
take a liking. This was <i>Little Dorrit</i>. I tried hard, but it made my
head ache even more than <i>Esmond</i> had done, and I laid it down, utterly
unable to comprehend the mystery which takes such an amount of dreary,
broken-up, tedious dialogue in the closing chapters to unravel.</p>

<hr />

<p>I took down <span class="smcap">Washington Irving's</span> <i>Sketch-book</i>, and read it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> with
delight. Fresh as ever! It did me good. So did <span class="smcap">Charles Lamb's</span> Essays.
And then guess what moved me to laughter, to tears, and to real
heartfelt gratitude that we should have had a writer who could leave us
such an immortal work? What? It is a gem. It is very small, but to my
mind, and not excepting any one of all he ever wrote, the most precious
in every way for its true humour, for its natural pathos, and for its
large-hearted Christian teaching, is <i>The Christmas Carol</i>, by <span class="smcap">Charles
Dickens</span>. Had this been his only book, it would have sufficed for his
imperishable fame.</p>

<hr />

<p>And then what made me chuckle and laugh? Why,<span class="smcap">Thackeray's</span> <i>Sultan Stork</i>,
which, somehow or other, I never remembered having read before this time
of convalescent leisure. It is <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> in his most frolicsome humour,
and, therefore, <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> at his best.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From an Anxious Householder.</span></p>

<a href="images/173a.png">
<img src="images/173.png" width="424" height="500" alt="CARPENTER" title="CARPENTER" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Toby</span>,&mdash;It was in my mind to write to you some days ago, but I
have had my time much occupied with a subject of domestic interest. In
fact, I have just been laying the carpet presented to me by our
fellow-citizens of the ancient and important community of Kidderminster.
The carpet, regarded individually, is a desirable and an acceptable
thing. It is, as you have observed in the newspaper reports, woven of
the wool known to the trade as the Queen's Clip. In colour it is a rich
damson, and in quality Wilton. Apart from its suitability and
acceptability, we here see in it the beginning of what I confess we
should be inclined to regard as a pleasing habit on the part of our
fellow-countrymen. As you are aware, my wife and myself have for some
years been the recipients of gifts consisting of what a well-known
person of the name of <i>Wemmick</i> was accustomed to call, articles of
portable property. Our journeys to Scotland were always marked by the
presentation of gifts that even became embarrassing by reason of their
quantity and variety. We have quite a stock of Paisley shawls. Dundee
marmalade is a drug in our domestic market. Plaids, snuff-boxes,
walking-sticks, and, above all, axes I have in abundance. Through the
medium of an interesting periodical, of which you may have
heard&mdash;(it is known as <i>Exchange and Mart</i>)&mdash;we have managed
to average our possessions, a process not entirely free from adventure.
In one instance an unscrupulous individual, probably a member of the
Primrose League, succeeded in obtaining a two-dozen case of marmalade
and a Scotch plaid presented by the working-men of Glasgow, in promise,
yet unfulfilled, of delivery of a bicycle warranted new. I have rather a
hankering after trying a bicycle. <span class="smcap">Lowe</span> gave his up with the ultimate
remainder of his Liberal principles. But in old times I have heard him
speak with enthusiasm of the exercise. When I noticed this person
advertising in <i>Exchange and Mart</i> his desire of bartering his bicycle,
we entered upon the negotiation which has ended so unfortunately. He has
our Paisley plaid and Dundee marmalade, and we have not his bicycle.</p>

<p>This, however, by the way. What I had at heart to write to you about,
suggested by the Kidderminster carpet, is the new opening here offered
for manifestations of political sympathy at a serious political crisis.
We are, to tell the truth, towards the close of a long career, a little
overburdened with articles of portable property of the kind already
indicated. But our residence is large, and, if I may say so, receptive.
Carpets, though a not unimportant feature in the furnishing of a house,
do not contain within themselves the full catalogue of a furnishing
establishment.</p>

<p>If Kidderminster has its carpets, there are other localities throughout
the Kingdom which have their tables and chairs, their bed-room
furniture, their curtains, their brass stair-rods, and their
gas-fittings. History will, I believe, look with indulgent eye upon an
ex-Premier, the Counsellor of Kings, the leader of a great Party,
assisting at the hauling in and laying down of an eleemosynary carpet,
the wool of which is made from Queen's Clip, has a rich damson colour,
and is of Wilton quality. Why should I not give a back to an arm-chair
presented by an admiring Liberal Association? or walk upstairs with a
bolster under either arm, token of the esteem and admiration of the West
of England Home Rulers?</p>

<p>I throw out these thoughts to you, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, as I sit in my study and
survey the carpet of Wilton quality, which covers the floor. As you will
have seen in the newspaper reports, "on entering the room where the
carpet was displayed the Right Honourable Gentleman remarked that it had
a quiet tone, which was so pleasant to the eye; adding that it was a
great mistake, (which used to be committed about fifty years ago) when
carpets were made with staring patterns." It is, I need hardly say, the
growth of Liberal principles which has effected this change in the
public taste for carpets. Whether indeed, suppose we were in need of a
battle-cry, "Our Quiet Tones and Our Liberal Principles," would not
serve as opposed to "Toryism and Staring Patterns," I am not certain.
These things we must leave to the evolution of time. Meanwhile I will
not deny in the confidence of a friendly letter that we could very well
do with a sofa, the tone and construction of which should, of course,
match the carpet from Kidderminster. If you are attending any public
meeting and you find the popular indignation against the Government of
Lord <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> rising to an ungovernable pitch, you might gently and
discreetly guide it in this direction.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Always yours faithfully,</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;A mangle and a garden-roller might later, and in due order, occupy
your kindly thought.</p>

<h3 class="sans">SOME NOTES AT STARMOUTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel Dering</span> has not recognised me yet. Naturally she would not expect
to find me being photographed on the beach with such a crew as this&mdash;but
she <i>will</i> in another instant, unless,&mdash;ah, <span class="smcap">Louise's</span> sunshade! my
presence of mind never <i>quite</i> deserts me. There is a slit in the
silk&mdash;through which I can see <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>. As soon as she discovers what the
excitement is all about, she turns away.... Thank goodness, she is gone!
I have saved the situation&mdash;but ruined the group ... they are all
annoyed with me. I had really no idea <span class="smcap">Louise</span> looked so plain when out of
temper!</p>

<p>As we go back, <span class="smcap">Alf</span> wants to know whether I noticed that "clipping girl."
He means <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>. <span class="smcap">Louise</span> says, he "ought to know better than to ask me
such things, considering my situation." Agree with <span class="smcap">Louise</span>.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i> I am staying at home; <i>nominally</i>, to work at the Drama
(still in very elementary stage) <i>really</i>, to think out the situation.
Remember now the <span class="smcap">Derings</span> have a yacht; they <i>may</i> only have put in here
for a day or two&mdash;if not, can I avoid being seen by her sooner or later?
The mere idea of meeting <i>her</i> when I am with <span class="smcap">Alf</span> or <span class="smcap">Ponking</span>, and my
Blazer acquaintances, makes me ill. (Not that I need distress myself,
for she would probably cut me!) Can't think in Mrs. <span class="smcap">Surge's</span> little front
parlour. I must get out, into the air! Let me see, <span class="smcap">Louise</span> and her Aunt
(and no doubt <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> and <span class="smcap">Alf</span>) will be at the Music Hall this evening,
as there is a "benefit" with the usual "galaxy of talent." If I keep
away from the sands (where I might see <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>), I shall be safe enough.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Why, he&#39;s a man of whacks!&quot; Shakspeare.</span>
</div>

<p>Turn into Public Gardens; nobody here just now, except a couple in
front, who seem to have quarrelled&mdash;at least the lady's voice sounds
displeased. Too dark to see, but as I come nearer&mdash;is it only my nervous
fancy that&mdash;? No, I can't be mistaken, that <i>is</i> <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> speaking now!
"Why will you persist in speaking to me?" she is saying, "I don't know
you&mdash;have the goodness to go away at once." Some impudent scoundrel is
annoying her! Didn't know anything could make me so angry. I don't stop
to think&mdash;before I know where I am, I have knocked the fellow down ... he
can't be more surprised than <i>I</i> am! It is all very well&mdash;but what is
to become of me when he <i>gets up again</i>? He is sure to make a row, and I
can't go <i>on</i> knocking him down! Must get <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> away first, should not
like to be pounded into shapelessness before her eyes. "Miss <span class="smcap">Dering</span>," I
say, "you&mdash;you had better go on&mdash;leave him to me," (it will probably be
the other way, though!) "Mr. <span class="smcap">Coney</span>!" she cries. "Oh, I am so glad!&mdash;but
don't hurt him any more&mdash;<i>please</i>." He is getting up, as well as I can
make out in the darkness, I am not <i>likely</i> to hurt him any more ... I
wish he would begin, this suspense is very trying. He <i>has</i> begun&mdash;to
weep bitterly! Never was so surprised in my life; he is too much upset
even to swear, simply sits in the gutter boohooing. If he knew how
grateful I am to him! However, I tell him sternly to "think himself
lucky it is no worse," and leave him to recover.</p>

<p>Must see <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> safe home after this. She and her father <i>did</i> come in
the yacht&mdash;they are at the Royal Hotel, and she missed her way and her
maid somehow, trying to find a Circulating Library. She really seems
pleased to meet me. It is not an original remark&mdash;but <i>what</i> a delight
it is to listen to the clear fresh tones of a well-bred girl&mdash;not that
<span class="smcap">Ethel</span>'s voice is anything to me <i>now!</i> She "can't imagine what I find to
do in Starmouth,"&mdash;then she did <i>not</i> recognise me this afternoon, which
is some comfort! I should like to tell her all, but it would be rather
uncalled-for just now, perhaps. We talk on general matters, as we used
to do. Singular how one can throw off one's troubles for the time&mdash;I am
actually <i>gay!</i> I can make <i>her</i> laugh, and what a pretty rippling laugh
she has! We have reached the Hotel&mdash;<i>already!</i></p>

</div>

<p>Now I am here, it would be rude not to go in and see old <span class="smcap">Dering</span>. I do.
He is most cordial. Am I alone down here? Critical, this. After all, I
<i>am</i> alone&mdash;in my lodgings. "Then I must come to luncheon on board the
<i>Amaryllis</i> to-morrow." <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> (I <i>must</i> get into the way of thinking of
her as "Miss <span class="smcap">Dering</span>") looks as if she expects me to accept. I had better
go, and find an opportunity of telling her about <span class="smcap">Louise</span>&mdash;who knows&mdash;they
might become bosom friends. No, hang it, <i>that's</i> out of the question!</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Derings'</span> private room opens on to the Esplanade; old <span class="smcap">Dering</span> comes to
the French windows, and calls out after me, "Don't forget. Lunch at two.
On board the <i>Amaryllis</i>&mdash;find her at the quay." "Thanks very much&mdash;I
<i>won't</i> forget. Good-night!" "Good-night!" Someone is waiting for me
under a lamp. It is <span class="smcap">Alf</span>, but I did not know him at first. "Why, where on
earth!"&mdash;I begin. He regards me reproachfully with his one efficient
eye, and I observe his nose is much swollen. Good heavens, I see it
all&mdash;I have knocked down my <i>future brother-in-law!</i> Well, it serves him
right.</p>

<p>He explains, sulkily; he meant no harm; never thought anyone would be
offended by being spoken to civil; <i>he</i> never met girls like that before
(which is likely enough); and to think I should have treated him that
savage and brutal&mdash;it was <i>that</i> upset him. Tell him I am sorry, but I
can't help it now. "Yes you can," he says, hoarsely. "You know this
girl&mdash;this Miss <span class="smcap">Derin'</span>," (he has followed us, it appears, and caught her
name)&mdash;"you don't ought to play dog in the manger <i>now</i>&mdash;I want you to
introduce me in a reg'lar way. I tell yer I'm down-right smitten."
Introduce <i>him</i>&mdash;to <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>! Never, not if I won the V.C. for it! "Then
you <i>look out!</i>"</p>

<p>He has gone off growling&mdash;the cub! He will tell <span class="smcap">Louise</span>. On second
thoughts, his own share in the business may prevent that&mdash;but it is
unfortunate.</p>

<span class="caption">Thrown over at a Watering-place.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Next Day.</i>&mdash;Have got leave of absence (without mentioning reason). I
believe I pleaded the Drama, as usual, and I <i>have</i> jotted down a line
or two. Am dressing for luncheon&mdash;somehow I take longer than usual.
Ready at last; the coast is clear, I am a trifle early, but I can stroll
gently down to the quay.... Turn a corner, and come upon <span class="smcap">Ponking</span>, with
<span class="smcap">Louise</span>. Fancy both look rather confused, but they are delighted to see
me. "Was I going any where in particular?" "No&mdash;nowhere in particular."
"Then I'd better come along with them&mdash;they have dined early, and are
doing the lions." <span class="smcap">Louise</span> makes such a point of it that I can't
refuse&mdash;must watch my chance, and slip off when I can.</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;We have done an ancient gaol, the church, and a fishermen's
almshouse&mdash;and I have not seen my chance <i>yet</i>. <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> determined to
see all he can for his money. <span class="smcap">Louise</span>, more demonstrative than she has
been of late, clings to my arm. It is past two, but we are working our
way, slowly, towards the quay. <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> suggests visit to Fisherring
Establishment. Now is my chance; say I won't go in&mdash;don't like
herrings&mdash;will wait outside. To my surprise, they actually meet me
half-way! "If you want to get back to your play-writing, old chap," says
<span class="smcap">Ponking</span> (really not a bad fellow, <span class="smcap">Ponking</span>!) "don't you mind <i>us</i>&mdash;we'll
take care of one another!" Just as deliverance is at hand, that infernal
<span class="smcap">Alf</span> comes up from the quay, with an eye that is positively <i>iridescent!</i>
"Oh, look at his poor eye!" cries <span class="smcap">Louise</span>. I look&mdash;and I see that he
means "<i>being nasty</i>." He addresses me: "Why ain't you on board your
swell yacht, taking lunch along with that girl, eh?" he inquires.
Exclamations from <span class="smcap">Louise</span>: "Girl? yacht? who? what?" and then&mdash;it all
comes out!</p>

<p>Painful scene; fortunate there are so few looking on. <span class="smcap">Louise</span> renounces
me for ever opposite the Town-hall. "She knew I was a muff, but she had
thought I was too much the gentleman to act deceitful!" <span class="smcap">Ponking</span> is of
opinion I "haven't a gentlemanly action in me." So is <span class="smcap">Alf</span>, who adds that
he "always felt somehow he could never make a pal of me." There is balm
in <i>that!</i></p>

<p>Thank goodness, it is over! I am <i>free</i>&mdash;free to think of <span class="smcap">Ethel</span> as much
as I like! I see now what a wretched infatuation all this has been. I
can tell her about it some day&mdash;if I think it necessary. I am not sure I
<i>shall</i> think it necessary&mdash;at all events, just yet.</p>

</div>

<p>I am a little late, but I can apologise for that. Odd&mdash;but I can't find
the <i>Amaryllis</i> anywhere! Ask. A seaman on a post says "There <i>was</i> a
yacht he see being towed out 'bout 'arf an hour back&mdash;he didn't take no
partickler notice of her name." No doubt I mistook the moorings&mdash;better
ask at hotel, perhaps. I do. Waiter says if I am the gentleman by name
of <span class="smcap">Coney</span>, there are two notes for me in Coffee-Room.</p>

<p>Open first&mdash;from Mr. <span class="smcap">Dering</span>.</p>

<p>"Regrets; unforeseen circumstances&mdash;compelled to sail at once, and give
up pleasure, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Second&mdash;from <span class="smcap">Ethel</span>; there is hope still&mdash;or would she write?</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. <span class="smcap">Coney</span>,&mdash;So sorry to go away without seeing you. You might have
told me of your engagement yourself, I think&mdash;I should have been so
interested. Your brother-in-law and his aunt thought it necessary to
call and inform us. We are delighted that you are having a pleasanter
time here than you gave us to understand last night. With best wishes
for all possible happiness," &amp;c.</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was <span class="smcap">Alf's</span> revenge&mdash;it was a good one! After that, I shake off
the sand of Starmouth&mdash;for ever!</p>

<h2>BOB SAWYER REDIVIVUS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>At the Middlesex Hospital.</i>)</p>

<p>Just been given what the newspapers call "the privileges and status of a
true Collegian,"&mdash;in other words find I'm no longer to be allowed to
live in the jolly old free-and-easy way, in one's own diggings, but am
to be boxed up inside the Hospital instead! Hang the Authorities! Should
like to cup them all.</p>

<p>Anyhow, got a decent room: can show it off to visitors. Visit from
Oxbridge friend. Seems surprised at smallness of my apartment. Says it's
"not <i>his</i> idea of living in College: more like living in <i>Quad</i>," he
adds, humorously. "Do I really mean to say," he asks, "that I am to
sleep in same room I live in, with only a curtain between?" Have to
confess such is the intention of the architect. He says, "if he was me,
he'd complain to the Dean." Don't like to show ignorance&mdash;so don't ask
him if he means Dean of <span class="smcap">Westminster</span> or <span class="smcap">St. Paul's.</span> Oxbridge friend
declines my invitation to "dine in Hall," and disappears.</p>

<p>Ah! They've given us a Smoking-room, anyhow. Is it a smoking-room? No&mdash;a
"Library and Reading-room." Disgusting! Ring for brandy-and-soda. Nobody
answers the bell! It seems the "Collegiate servants" go out of College
between meals. Nothing to do, so amuse myself for an hour in
Dissecting-room. Pine for freedom. Go to entrance and am stopped by
Porter. Porter says, "Gentlemen not allowed to leave Hospital after dark
without leave of House Surgeon." Tell Porter I'm a child of nature, and
that I want to visit a dying relative. Porter incredulous&mdash;proposes
sending one of the resident Physicians instead. No, thanks! Retire to
room and think of old rollicking days. Nothing to do. Wonder if Porter
would let me bleed him. No, perhaps he's not in the vein.</p>

<p><i>Hall Dinner.</i>&mdash;Hate dining in common&mdash;reminds one of the Zoo. Student
next to me very <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shoppy'">sloppy</ins>. Brings a bone in with him, and puts it on table,
studying it between courses. Tell him, pleasantly, it'll be a bone of
contention if he does not remove it. He doesn't understand. Replies,
quite seriously, that it's the "<i>os humeri</i>."</p>

<p><i>After Dinner.</i>&mdash;Tedious. Just the time when the "Lion Comique" is
"coming on" at the Parthenon Music Hall. And I can't get out to hear
him!</p>

<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;Had jolly spree, after all&mdash;also after Hall. Tied new curtains
together and let myself down into street, amid yells of large crowd.
Rather damaged right scapula, but can't be helped. Went to Gaiety; jolly
supper, met Ben Allen and a lot of chappies, who are at Bart's and
haven't any of these ridiculous Collegiate regulations, and had high old
time. How to get back, though? Ay, "there's the rub,"&mdash;worse than
rubbing scapula, too.</p>

<p>Boldest plan best. Rap Porter up. Porter surprised to see me. Says it's
"past one o'clock," and wants to know how I got out. Tell him I'm a
child of nature, and if he reports me to House Surgeon I shall certainly
cup him to-morrow. Porter asserts, quite untruly, that I am intoxicated.</p>

<p><i>Next Day.</i>&mdash;Authorities have heard how I escaped from Hospital last
night. Also Porter&mdash;the idiot!&mdash;has complained that he goes in fear of
his life because of my threats. On the whole, Hospital Authorities come
to conclusion to ask me to leave, as "they think I am not fitted for
Collegiate life," and I quite agree with them. Pack up, and pack off.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE TWO GOATS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Old Fable with a New Application.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>For the benefit of Bolton.</i>)</p>

<p>Two bellicose goats once encountered each other in the middle of a
narrow bridge spanning a deep gulf and a raging torrent. To pass each
other seemed (to them) impossible, at least without much more careful
and courteous mutual self-adjustment than either was at all disposed
for. For one or the other to make way by temporarily backing, was, of
course&mdash;to bellicose goats&mdash;entirely out of the question. The only
alternative was clearly a butting-match.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<a href="images/180ii.png">
<img src="images/180.png" width="480" height="305" alt="THE TWO GOATS." title="THE TWO GOATS." /></a>
</div>

<p>Our angry goats entered upon it with great gusto. Heads hotly
encountered, horns angrily collided. The harder the hits the less did
either feel disposed to give way.</p>

<p>But a narrow bridge over a deep gulf is a bad place for a battle <i>à
outrance</i>. The infuriated animals quickly settled the point at issue, in
a way as final as unpleasant, by butting each other over into the gulf,
leaving the disputed path clear for the passage of creatures more
conciliatory and less cantankerous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Application.</span></p>

<p>Two objects cannot occupy the same space&mdash;even in Bolton. Battles upon
bridges&mdash;even iron bridges&mdash;are bad things. A quarrel between two
parties&mdash;even if they represent Capital and Labour&mdash;cannot be regarded
as satisfactorily settled by the destruction of both&mdash;unless they are
thieves, or Kilkenny cats. It is much easier to get into a gulf&mdash;even
the gulf of Bankruptcy&mdash;than out of it. To parties expiring at the
bottom of a gulf, into which they have hurled each other, it is small
consolation to see more peaceful persons&mdash;though they be
foreigners&mdash;making better use of the bridge which might have carried
them both safely over.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>A Collection of Thackeray's Letters</i> (1847 to 1855. <span class="smcap">Smith &amp; Elder</span>).&mdash;It
must have cost Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brookfield</span> a good deal of mental anxiety before she
decided upon giving publicity to this correspondence. But she has
undoubtedly done well and wisely, as everybody interested in the
personal <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>, outside and away from his works, will gratefully
acknowledge. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> was always fond of alluding to himself as the
Showman with the puppets, or portraying himself as taking off the
cap-and-bells when, from behind the grinning mask, peep out the sad eyes
and the rueful countenance. Now in these Letters we are sometimes
admitted behind the scenes, as, for instance, when he is just going to
work; but, as a rule, we see him in his leisure, out for a holiday,
amusing himself and others, and enjoying himself like an overgrown
schoolboy full of fun and frolic, not a bit of a cynic, and there are no
sad eyes and rueful countenance when the mask is off. The peculiar charm
of these Letters is that they are so evidently private; there is nothing
of the <i>poseur</i> about them. They were never intended to be addressed
<i>urbi et orbi</i>.</p>

<p>One favourite style of amusing himself in writing he had, which, by the
way, rather calls to mind the way <i>Mr. Peter Magnus</i> had of amusing his
friends, and that was mis-spelling, and spelling in Cockney fashion. How
he must have revelled in writing <i>Jeames's Diary!</i> The burlesque element
of humour was irrepressible in <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>, and found vent through pen and
pencil. Nearly all his sketches, with remarkable exceptions, are, more
or less, grotesque. Many of his Vignettes, with which he illustrated his
novels, cannot fail to suggest a kind of Dicky-Doyleian humour. Two
characteristics of the man are brought out strongly in these letters;
first, his humility as regards his own work (he was proud in other
matters), and, secondly, his generosity as exhibited in his unaffected
admiration for the work of <span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>.</p>

<p>Occasionally we catch a glimpse of his religious tendencies, which are
at one time influenced by <span class="smcap">J. H. Newman</span>, at another by <span class="smcap">J. S. Mill</span>; and it
is interesting to read his <i>naïve</i> utterances about Scripture, showing
that whatever lectures he may have attended at Cambridge, those on
Divinity, or on the Greek Testament, could not have been among them. And
this indeed is highly probable. His kindness of heart is evident
throughout. His laughing at himself as a Snob when affecting the company
of great people is delightful, though there seems to be in this
self-ridicule something of the true word spoken in jest. He makes a
burlesque flourish&mdash;so like him&mdash;about sending in "his resignation" to
<i>Mr. Punch</i>. As a matter of fact, he remained an honorary member of <i>Mr.
Punch's</i> Cabinet Council, and retained his seat at <i>Mr. Punch's</i> table,
up to the time of his death. The present writer remembers <span class="smcap">William
Makepeace Thackeray</span> being frequently present in <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Council
Chamber, <i>Consule Marco</i>. A most interesting, amusing, and instructive
book, especially to literary men&mdash;(some novelists must be delighted at
finding <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> reading over the previous portions of his own serial
in order to recall the names of his characters, and his frantic joy at
hitting on the title of <i>Vanity Fair</i>)&mdash;is this collection of
<span class="smcap">Thackeray's</span> Letters. To Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brookfield</span> our heartiest thanks are due.</p>

<p><i>Like and Unlike.</i> By Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon</span>. Everybody who cares about a novel
with a good plot so well worked out that the excitement is kept up
through the three volumes and culminates with the last chapter of the
story, must "Like" and can never again "Unlike," this the latest and
certainly one of the best of Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon's</span> novels. Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon</span> is our
most dramatic novelist. Her method is to interest the reader at once
with the very first line, just as that Master-Dramatist of our time <span class="smcap">Dion
Boucicault</span> would rivet the attention of an audience by the action at the
opening of the piece, even before a line of the dialogue had been
spoken. This authoress never wastes her own time and that of her reader,
by giving up any number of pages at the outset to a minute description
of scenery, to a history of a certain family, to a wearisome account of
the habits and customs of the natives, or to explaining peculiarities in
manners and dialect which are to form one of the principal charms of the
story. No: Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon</span> is dramatic just as far as the drama can assist
her, and then she is the genuine novelist. A few touches present her
characters living before the reader, and the story easily developes
itself in, apparently, the most natural manner possible. <i>Like and
Unlike</i> will make many people late for dinner, and will keep a number of
persons up at night when they ought to be soundly sleeping. These are
two sure tests of a really well-told sensational novel. <i>Vive</i> Miss
<span class="smcap">Braddon</span>!</p>

<h3>A LICHFIELD HOUSE OF CALL.</h3>

<p>Shade of <span class="smcap">Boswell</span>, awake, arise! Know that the Lord Mayor of Lichfield,
Mr. <span class="smcap">A. C. Baxter</span>, has announced in the <i>Times</i> that the house Dr.
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span> was born in is put up for sale by auction on the 20th inst. Now,
then, is the time for a big brewer who would like to get bigger, or any
licensed victualler, with command of a moderate capital, to invest it in
the purchase of the premises in which the great Lexicographer and
Moralist first saw the light, and in the conversion of them into a
public-house, to be called and known by the sign and name of "The
Johnson's Head." A likeness of Dr. <span class="smcap">Johnson,</span> copied by a competent Artist
from the best of Sir <span class="smcap">Joshua Reynolds's</span> portraits, and mounted on the
signboard, would be sure to attract multitudes of respectable people,
and others, besides forming a decoration of the tavern at Lichfield, and
an ornament to that town. A pub. associated with one of the highest
names in literature could hardly fail to be frequented by numerous
bookmakers. The memory of Dr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> might, however, be honoured by the
preservation of his home for what many may consider a nobler purpose
than that of a liquor-shop; and those who are of that opinion should
look sharp and secure his birthplace by coming forward, and taking care
that, when under the hammer, it shall be knocked down on their own
account to the highest bidder. "The man who could make a pun would pick
a pocket;" true, but he might prefer putting his hand in his own to
commemorate the name of the great <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>, by helping to stand Sam.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
